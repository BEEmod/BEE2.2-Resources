### This is a legacy version of BEEmod.

This repository contains the assets and compiled executables for an old version of the BEE2. This version is no longer maintained, very buggy, and not recommended for new maps.

See [BEE2.4](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2.4) for the currently maintained version of BEEmod, or [BEE1.5](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEEMOD) for the original version which does not include an application at all.
